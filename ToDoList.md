# F912821_Enhancements_for_Maxwell-Fluent_co-simulation_for_Electric_Arc_Application
This feature is the enhancement for electrical arc modeling simulation. The co-simulation happens among AEDT, Fluent, Twin Builder, and Motion using System Coupling.

# To Do List and issues for futher
- If we do not have geometry change, then we do not need to have re-mesh in Maxwell
